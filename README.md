## Project Description

This Quiz App lets the user choose a programming language to take a quiz in. It includes the following features:

- Each question has a time limit of **20 seconds**.
- You can either select an answer (right or wrong), or let the time expire â€” which is counted as a wrong answer.
- At the end of each quiz, youâ€™ll see the number of correct and incorrect answers.
- The result page includes three buttons:
  - **Try Again**
  - **Try New Language**
  - **Close the App**
